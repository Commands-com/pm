# Project Statistics and Workflow Insights:
# 
# This complex project contains:
# - 4 Epics (major platform components)
# - 8 Stories (user-focused features)  
# - 28 Tasks (specific work items)
#
# Task Status Distribution:
# - COMPLETED: 6 tasks (foundational work done)
# - IN_PROGRESS: 3 tasks (actively being developed)
# - TODO: 19 tasks (ready for assignment)
# - BLOCKED: 0 tasks (no current blockers)
#
# Recommended Agent Assignment Strategy:
#
# Backend/API Specialists:
# - All "Implement * API" tasks
# - Database design and migration tasks
# - Payment and shipping integration tasks
#
# Frontend/UI Specialists:  
# - All "Build * UI" and "Create * interface" tasks
# - User experience and interaction design
# - Dashboard and customer-facing components
#
# DevOps/Infrastructure:
# - File upload and storage systems
# - Search infrastructure (Elasticsearch)
# - Performance optimization tasks
#
# Full-Stack Developers:
# - End-to-end feature implementation
# - Cross-system integration tasks
# - Complex workflow development
#
# MCP Agent Usage Patterns:
#
# 1. Query by Specialty:
#    get_available_tasks(status="TODO") + filter by task description
#
# 2. Team Coordination:
#    - Backend completes API before frontend starts UI
#    - Database tasks completed before dependent API work
#    - Integration tasks require multiple system components
#
# 3. Progressive Development:
#    - Foundation Epic (highest priority)
#    - Product Catalog (depends on foundation)
#    - Shopping Cart (depends on product catalog)
#    - Order Management (depends on cart and payment)
#
# 4. Parallel Work Opportunities:
#    - UI and API development for different features
#    - Independent epic development by separate teams
#    - Testing and documentation alongside development
#
# Real-World Application:
# This structure mirrors actual e-commerce platform development where:
# - Multiple teams work concurrently on different platform areas
# - Dependencies between components require coordination
# - Tasks vary in complexity from simple UI changes to complex integrations
# - Progress tracking across epics provides executive visibility
# - Lock management prevents merge conflicts and duplicate work
