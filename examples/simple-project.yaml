# Simple Project Example for Testing and Demo
# 
# This file demonstrates the basic YAML project structure for Project Manager MCP.
# Use this as a template for small projects or as a starting point for larger ones.
#
# YAML Structure Hierarchy:
#   Epic (high-level initiative)
#   └── Story (user-focused feature)
#       └── Task (specific work item)
#
# Import this project with:
#   project-manager-mcp --project examples/simple-project.yaml
#
# Features demonstrated:
# - Single epic with two related stories
# - Mix of task statuses (TODO, IN_PROGRESS)
# - Realistic task descriptions for development workflow
# - Proper YAML formatting and indentation

# Root level: epics array contains all high-level project initiatives
epics:
  - name: "User Authentication System"                    # Epic name (required)
    description: "Basic user login and registration functionality"  # Epic description (optional but recommended)
    status: "ACTIVE"                                      # Epic status (required): ACTIVE, PLANNED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
    
    # Stories array: user-focused features within this epic
    stories:
      - name: "User Registration Flow"                    # Story name (required)
        description: "Allow new users to create accounts" # Story description (optional but recommended)
        status: "TODO"                                    # Story status (required): TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED
        
        # Tasks array: specific work items to complete this story
        tasks:
          - name: "Create registration form UI"           # Task name (required)
            description: "Design and implement user registration form"  # Task description (optional but recommended)
            status: "TODO"                               # Task status (required): TODO/pending, IN_PROGRESS/in_progress, COMPLETED/completed, BLOCKED/blocked
            
          - name: "Implement registration API endpoint"
            description: "Backend endpoint to handle user registration"

        tasks:
          - name: "Create login form UI"

            status: "IN_PROGRESS"                         # This task is currently being worked on
            
          - name: "Implement login API endpoint"
            description: "Backend endpoint to handle user authentication"

# Status Value Reference:
# 
# Epic Status Values:
#   - ACTIVE: Currently being worked on
#   - PLANNED: Future epic, not yet started  
#   - COMPLETED: All stories and tasks finished
#   - CANCELLED: Epic abandoned or no longer needed
#
# Story Status Values:
#   - TODO: Not yet started
#   - IN_PROGRESS: Currently being developed
#   - COMPLETED: All tasks finished
#   - BLOCKED: Cannot proceed due to dependencies/issues
#
# Task Status Values:
#   - TODO or pending: Ready for work
#   - IN_PROGRESS or in_progress: Currently being worked on
#   - COMPLETED or completed: Finished and ready for review/deployment
#   - BLOCKED or blocked: Cannot proceed due to dependencies/issues
#
# MCP Agent Workflow:
# 1. Query available tasks: get_available_tasks(status="TODO")
# 2. Acquire exclusive lock: acquire_task_lock(task_id, agent_id)
# 3. Work on the task...
# 4. Update progress: update_task_status(task_id, "completed", agent_id)
# 
# The system automatically:
# - Prevents multiple agents from working on the same task
# - Releases locks when tasks are completed
# - Broadcasts real-time updates to the web dashboard
# - Maintains task history and agent assignments
